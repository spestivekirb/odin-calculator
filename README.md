## Overview:
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. It is the third and final one of three JavaScript-centric projects. It is primarily about the use of objects and the DOM in JavaScript, though the HTML, CSS and git techniques as well as other JavaScript functions learnt throughout the "course" will be tested here too.


## Reflection:
This project was by far the most difficult of the foundations ones for me. I am happy with my decision to do the extra challenges, and how it turned out. I also added some colors and selector boxes to make it look nicer, which made it feel more personal.
